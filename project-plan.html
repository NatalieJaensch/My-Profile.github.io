<h1>Project Plan</h1>
<br>
<body>
<p>My project is a farm management application that offers herd management and pasture management databases and combines data from several existing sources to provide valuable insights into the requirements of dairy farms and the health of their cattle and pastures. The application will also assist with the business management side of running a dairy business.<br>
<br>
<br>According to the Dairy Australia website, there are 5,700 dairy farms spread out across Australia. I believe that no matter the size of the farm, this app could be hugely beneficial to any dairy farm manager.
<br>
<br>There are many resources available to dairy farm managers, such as the CSIRO’s Pastures From Space. Unfortunately, capturing all of this information in a timely, efficient and effective manner is time-consuming, and requires a lot of manual input and output. Some websites contain these features individually, but a lack of integration and connectivity means that often the user is required to operate multiple databases with the same information. It is time-consuming and leaves a massive opportunity for inconsistencies between applications. The purpose of a central dashboard is to allow easy input of data and produce results from internal and external data sources to send and receive information, receive updates, reminders and notifications, and generate reports that enable strategic planning and decision-making. The application will also be user friendly. According to an article published on the Stock & Land website in January 2020, the median age for dairy farmers is 53 to 56 years of age.  [1] This age group is likely to possess only a basic level of computer literacy, so the user interface needs to be uncomplicated and straightforward.
<br>
<br>The inspiration for my project came from overhearing a discussion between my brother and sister, who are both dairy farmers. They expressed their frustrations at their current system of writing things down on paper or in the Notes app on their phone and then having to enter it into their desktop PCs in order to store the information, which is ineffective and inefficient.
<br>
<br>Software and app development is one of the IT fields that interest me, so I began paying attention to the conversation and started asking questions. I asked my brother and sister what they would like to see developed in terms of software or programs. My sister offered an example of fertiliser usage. Currently, she has to manually track the fertiliser use, such as how much was required for a particular pasture and then emailing or sending a text message to their supplier with this information, which was time-consuming. My brother said that he would like to be able to combine all of the information that he inputs into one report that he can use to make strategic decisions regarding herd and pasture management.
<br>
<br>The application will ask the user to create an account. This account will enable the user to access their information across any of the three formats it will be available in - a web-based solution, a desktop app and a smartphone app. The reason for the three formats is for convenience. Many dairy farm managers use a PC to conduct business, so a desktop app is beneficial. A smartphone app offers convenience and the ability to send and retrieve data without the need to return to a PC to do so. The portability of a mobile app is particularly useful when performing onsite inspections of pastures and herds. A web-based solution would be advantageous if the need arises to access your information off-site and the smartphone app is insufficient.
<br>
<br>There will be a herd management feature that allows the user to enter details about each animal, including but not limited to identification details (name and tag number), lactation cycles and subsequent feed requirements, herd group, illness and medication, and insemination tracking. The user can communicate this information to others, such as veterinarians and feed suppliers.
<br>
<br>The pasture management system will utilise integration with Pastures from Space to monitor pasture availability and requirements. The CSIRO, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture of WA and Landgate, developed Pastures from Space to assist Australian agricultural business managers in making tactical and strategic decisions by providing information to the user in near real-time at whole-farm and within-paddock levels by utilising satellite technology. It advises on the seasonal trajectory of pasture availability which can assist farm managers in mitigating the risk of future production, particularly when provided in the context of previous years. It also provides estimates of pasture production to accurately and quantitatively predict the amount of ‘feed on offer’, and can also forecast growth rates. [2] The data provided by Pastures from Space can be communicated to other vendors in the supply chain to create an effective pasture management system.
<br>
<br>My application would utilise a cloud-based file hosting solution such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Docs in order to store reports and communication.
<br>It would also possess the ability to connect with the user’s email service and have access to the user’s contacts allows for accessible communication with suppliers and vendors that do not have API capabilities.
<br>
<br>Many farm managers use online bookkeeping solutions to manage their financial business. It is my vision to build integration with the users bookkeeping solution provider with my application to provide easy access to the bookkeeping application without having to navigate between multiple applications.
<br>The user is required to have a PC or smart device, such as a phone or tablet. An internet connection will also be required to access the online components of the application. The application will not require any additional equipment. Access to an internet connection is a potential obstacle for users in more remote rural locations where internet access may be unavailable or unreliable.
<br>
<br>A comprehensive understanding of HTML and Javascript will be required to build the software. In addition to the content covered in the Bachelor of Information Technology, I will use services such as Codecademy and w3schools to bolster my knowledge and enhance my skills. I am very fortunate to have the support of a family member who is a graphic designer and has experience in website development in order to build a web application. To build the app, I could utilise an app builder tool such as MIT App Inventor or Microsoft PowerApp.
<br>
<br>If my application is successful, it will be a tool that time-poor dairy farmers can use to make the daily operation and management of their dairy farms easier. Those in the Australian dairy industry are doing it tough, and I have witnessed the struggles that my brother and sister have endured for more than a decade. My vision is to develop technology that gives them all the valuable information they require in one central location so they can be better informed and can make better decisions. The ultimate goal is to make their lives that little bit less stressful. Another successful outcome for me would be that their time can be better spent with their families rather than wasted on transcribing hand-written notes onto a PC.
