I was born in Warragul, Victoria, in December 1987. The youngest of four children, I have two brothers and a sister. Our late father was a truck driver; our mother works in customer service. I grew up in Trafalgar, where I attended the local primary and secondary school.

I graduated from Trafalgar High School in 2005. Unlike many of my peers, I had not decided what I wanted to do, career-wise, so I opted to get a job rather than go to university straight away. My first job was as a trainee law clerk at a law firm in Traralgon. It sparked an interest in law, so I started to make plans to study law. I completed my Certificate IV in Business Administration while at this firm.

My plans were put on hold when I discovered that I was expecting my first child. My son was born in December 2007, just shy of my 20th birthday. From the time my son was 12 months old until when my daughter was born in 2010, I worked as a law clerk at a firm in Morwell. When I re-entered the workforce in 2013, I worked as an administrative assistant at an accounting firm in Morwell.

My husband and I got married in November 2015. My husband is South Australian born and raised, and his entire family lives there, so our wedding was in Semaphore, which is approximately five minutes from Port Adelaide. 

Sport is a massive part of my life. I play netball for the Traralgon Football Netball Club (my husband is on their senior football team), and for five years, I was the secretary and club manager for the Ex-students Cricket Club, for who my husband is the B-grade captain. I also coach my daughter's netball team and have been the team manager for my son's junior football team twice.

Fun fact: I do not follow one particular AFL team, for a unique reason â€“ I have not one but three AFL footballers in my family (two retired, one current). See if you can guess who they are from the clubs I have held memberships with and their player numbers:

1.	I have held memberships at St Kilda, Sydney, Adelaide, Port Adelaide and Hawthorn

2.	No. 4, No. 10 and No. 20. 

## Interest in IT

It was when I took the job at the Morwell accounting firm that I discovered my interest in IT. The firm was transitioning from using Reckon APS for their accounting preparation software to Xero, which is a Cloud-based accounting system. I was the champion for this process and worked closely with the developers to complete the transition efficiently and successfully. The transition also affected other programs the firm used, such as ATO Paper Buster which used OCR to process many types of documents. There were significant changes between the APS and Xero outputs, so it required changes to the ATO Paper Buster templates. I found that I was able to make these changes easily, a process that was usually handled by a specific team from the developers.

Similarly, the Traralgon-based accounting firm that I began working for in 2017 also underwent a transitionary process. This time, they were moving from a document management application called Reckon Virtual Cabinet to an application developed by Business Fitness called HowNow. I was nominated as the process champion due to my previous experience and my technical skills and interest. Again, I worked closely with the developers to ensure that this process was smooth. Transitioning almost one million documents from one application to another required a lot of back-end mapping, but ultimately a good result was achieved. I believe that it was my keen interest in IT and my ability to learn these technical skills quickly that assisted with ensuring this good result.

A proud moment for me came after the firm began using HowNow, and I was tasked with creating custom letter templates to replace the templates that the firm had used for the previous ten years. I was creating a complicated letter and sought feedback from one of the content developers. He was so impressed by how quickly I had picked up the process that his manager contacted me shortly afterwards to offer me a job on their content development team.

I chose to study at RMIT for their stellar reputation in providing world-class training to their students. Based on my previous limited experience, I would like to explore a career in development or technical support, and what I expect to learn from my studies is the vital skills that will start me on my chosen career pathway. 

## Ideal Job

I am quite open-minded when it comes to what my ideal job in IT would be. My initial thoughts are that I would like a technical support/help desk role because I feel that it would combine my vast customer service experience with my learned IT skills. My ideal job would give me exposure to different problems and issues and allow me to maximise the use of the skills and knowledge gained from my tertiary learning.

I found a [Desktop Services Administrator](https://www.seek.com.au/job/50562678?type=standout#searchRequestToken=936952e1-b36d-4689-ab50-eb0e33b8ab9f) position advertised on Seek.com.au. The role has a high level of customer service via face-to-face and telephone methods, with a focus on process improvement and innovation to provide a better experience for the customers. I have previous experience in finance and accounting, so the industry is not entirely unfamiliar to me. There is also flexibility in working arrangements which is a crucial aspect of any role for me, as my priority is first and foremost my children.

The advertised role is for a large organisation with multiple locations. A role in a large multi-faceted organisation appeals to me because, aside from flexibility, there tends to be more opportunity to professional development and growth within the organisation that often does not exist in smaller businesses. 
The advertised role calls for experiences in several specific products and systems, such as Microsoft Back Office products, ServiceNow and Patch management, and ITIL frameworks. In addition to technical knowledge, the role requires demonstrated experience with face to face customer service in a dynamic, product-driven environment.

I have high-level customer service skills, and I also believe that my interpersonal and communication skills would be well suited to this position. The role calls for a candidate who is approachable, empathetic and helpful, which I feel are qualities that I possess. Coming from an accounting background has given me much exposure to people who are often feeling frustrated with organisations such as the ATO. The ability to understand complex governmental processes and then convey them to clients sympathetically and concisely is a critical skill that I have developed over my career, which I feel would be an asset to this particular role. 

I plan to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology studies with RMIT in 2023. A significant part of my role at ASIC involves IT, so I will learn valuable skills and knowledge on the job, in addition to building on the customer service skills that I already possess. Through other personal connections, I have met a person who works for a government body as a business support technician. He has offered to assist and mentor me through my studies, offering advice on the practical applications of what I am studying.
