I was born in Warragul, Victoria, in December 1987. The youngest of four children, I have two brothers and a sister. Our late father was a truck driver; our mother works in customer service. I grew up in Trafalgar, where I attended the local primary and secondary school.

I graduated from Trafalgar High School in 2005. Unlike many of my peers, I had not decided what I wanted to do, career-wise, so I opted to get a job rather than go to university straight away. My first job was as a trainee law clerk at a law firm in Traralgon. It sparked an interest in law, so I completed my Certificate IV in Business Administration as a pathway to study law.

My plans were put on hold when I discovered that I was expecting my first child. My son was born in December 2007, just shy of my 20th birthday. From the time my son was 12 months old until when my daughter was born in 2010, I worked as a law clerk at a firm in Morwell. When I re-entered the workforce in 2013, I worked as an administrative assistant at an accounting firm in Morwell.

My husband and I got married in November 2015. My husband is South Australian born and raised, and his entire family lives there, so our wedding was in Semaphore, which is approximately five minutes from Port Adelaide. 

Sport is a massive part of my life. I play netball for the Traralgon Football Netball Club (my husband is on their senior football team), and for five years, I was the secretary and club manager for the Ex-students Cricket Club, for who my husband is the B-grade captain. I also coach my daughter's netball team and have been the team manager for my son's junior football team twice.

Fun fact: I do not follow one particular AFL team, for a unique reason – I have not one but three AFL footballers in my family (two retired, one current). See if you can guess who they are from the clubs I have held memberships with and their player numbers:

1.	I have held memberships at St Kilda, Sydney, Adelaide, Port Adelaide and Hawthorn

2.	No. 4, No. 10 and No. 20. 

## Interest in IT

It was when I took the job at the Morwell accounting firm that I discovered my interest in IT. The firm was transitioning from using Reckon APS for their accounting preparation software to Xero, which is a Cloud-based accounting system. I was the champion for this process and worked closely with the developers to complete the transition efficiently and successfully. The transition also affected other programs the firm used, such as ATO Paper Buster which used OCR to process many types of documents. There were significant changes between the APS and Xero outputs, so it required changes to the ATO Paper Buster templates. I found that I was able to make these changes easily, a process that was usually handled by a specific team from the developers.

Similarly, the Traralgon-based accounting firm that I began working for in 2017 also underwent a transitionary process. This time, they were moving from a document management application called Reckon Virtual Cabinet to an application developed by Business Fitness called HowNow. I was nominated as the process champion due to my previous experience and my technical skills and interest. Again, I worked closely with the developers to ensure that this process was smooth. Transitioning almost one million documents from one application to another required a lot of back-end mapping, but ultimately a good result was achieved. I believe that it was my keen interest in IT and my ability to learn these technical skills quickly that assisted with ensuring this good result.

A proud moment for me came after the firm began using HowNow, and I was tasked with creating custom letter templates to replace the templates that the firm had used for the previous ten years. I was creating a complicated letter and sought feedback from one of the content developers. He was so impressed by how quickly I had picked up the process that his manager contacted me shortly afterwards to offer me a job on their content development team.

I chose to study at RMIT for their stellar reputation in providing world-class training to their students. Based on my previous limited experience, I would like to explore a career in development or technical support, and what I expect to learn from my studies is the vital skills that will start me on my chosen career pathway. 

## Ideal Job

I am quite open-minded when it comes to what my ideal job in IT would be. My initial thoughts are that I would like a technical support/help desk role because I feel that it would combine my vast customer service experience with my learned IT skills. My ideal job would give me exposure to different problems and issues and allow me to maximise the use of the skills and knowledge gained from my tertiary learning.

I found a [Desktop Services Administrator](https://www.seek.com.au/job/50562678?type=standout#searchRequestToken=936952e1-b36d-4689-ab50-eb0e33b8ab9f) position advertised on Seek.com.au. The role has a high level of customer service via face-to-face and telephone methods, with a focus on process improvement and innovation to provide a better experience for the customers. I have previous experience in finance and accounting, so the industry is not entirely unfamiliar to me. There is also flexibility in working arrangements which is a crucial aspect of any role for me, as my priority is first and foremost my children.

The advertised role is for a large organisation with multiple locations. A role in a large multi-faceted organisation appeals to me because, aside from flexibility, there tends to be more opportunity to professional development and growth within the organisation that often does not exist in smaller businesses. 
The advertised role calls for experiences in several specific products and systems, such as Microsoft Back Office products, ServiceNow and Patch management, and ITIL frameworks. In addition to technical knowledge, the role requires demonstrated experience with face to face customer service in a dynamic, product-driven environment.

I have high-level customer service skills, and I also believe that my interpersonal and communication skills would be well suited to this position. The role calls for a candidate who is approachable, empathetic and helpful, which I feel are qualities that I possess. Coming from an accounting background has given me much exposure to people who are often feeling frustrated with organisations such as the ATO. The ability to understand complex governmental processes and then convey them to clients sympathetically and concisely is a critical skill that I have developed over my career, which I feel would be an asset to this particular role. 

I plan to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology studies with RMIT in 2023. A significant part of my role at ASIC involves IT, so I will learn valuable skills and knowledge on the job, in addition to building on the customer service skills that I already possess. Through other personal connections, I have met a person who works for a government body as a business support technician. He has offered to assist and mentor me through my studies, offering advice on the practical applications of what I am studying.
 
## Personal Profile
### Test No. 1: Myer-Briggs Test

The results of my Myer-Briggs Personality Test concluded that I am an INTJ or the Architect personality type.

>"An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one."
>The INTJ personality type is the rarest of the 16 types, making up two per cent of the population. Female INTJs are even rarer, making up just 0.8%. People with this personality type are best suited to IT careers owing to their ability to convert complex principles into clear and actionable strategies.[1]

There has been some criticism of the Myer-Briggs Test for the inconstancy of the results:

>"Research has found that as many as 50 per cent of people arrive at a different result the second time they take a test, even if it's just five weeks later."[2]

I have undertaken the Myer-Briggs Test twice – the first time was in 2017, and the second time was when completing this assignment. On both occasions, I received the same result. Criticism of the validity of the results notwithstanding, I believe that the results give an accurate indication of my personality type as I could quickly identify and agree with the explanations and descriptions of typical INTJ traits. In addition to suggested career pathways and workplace habits, the Myer-Briggs Test also provides insights into personal relationship behaviours, and strengths and weaknesses. Some examples of an INTJ personality type’s strengths are high self-confidence, independence and decisiveness. Some weaknesses are arrogance, judgmental and romantically clueless. I recognise these as being some of my more prominent personality traits and thus accept them as being an accurate representation of my personality type.

### Test No. 2: The 'Learning Style' Test

According to the results of the learning style test, I am 40.2% Pragmatic and 40.2% Theorist.

_Pragmatists_ prefer the practical approach, needing to be able to put their learning into practice in the real world. The pragmatic approach to learning includes the use of practicals, case studies, problem setting, and discussions. _Theorists_ prefer to think through their problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity. Learning methods suited to theorists are models, classroom response systems, story-telling and quotes, and tutorials.[3]

I would agree with the results of this test. I have found with the _Introduction to Information Technology_ and the _Introduction of Programming_ courses that I am currently undertaking that I was able to grasp the concepts we are learning about once I could experiment with tutorials and practical demonstrations.

### Test No. 3: Fisher Temperament Inventory

The Fisher Temperament Inventory (FTI) is a measure of personality based on the idea that an individual’s behaviour is influenced by the dominance of particular neurotransmitters in the brain. The FTI identifies four chemical subsystems of the brain - dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and oestrogen - and measures four scales of behaviour believed to be produced by those systems, to give a result on an overall temperament type. The FTI test consists of 62 statements that the individual rates on a four-point scale of how much they agree with each statement.

These are my results of the Fisher Temperament Inventory test. Each score on its four scales ranges from 0 to 43.

Temperament | Associated Neurochemicals | My Score
----------- | ------------ | ------------
Curious / Energetic | dopamine, norepinephrine | 15 / 43
Cautious/Social Norm Compliant | serotonin | 37 / 43
Analytical/Tough-minded | testosterone | 36 / 43
Prosocial/Empathetic	| estrogen, oxytocin |	16 / 43

My answer profile matches most strongly to the Cautious/Social Norm Compliant temperament.

>“This temperament is dominated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is involved in relaxation and social belonging. People with this temperament are orderly and careful. They like to fit in with their social group and are wary of people who deviate. They are loyal.” [4]

### Test Conclusion

#### What do the results of these tests mean to me?

There is consistency in each of the results of the tests. Each of them describes me as taking a logical, pragmatic, cautious approach to matters which I believe is why I am drawn to law, accounting and IT.

#### How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?

I do not feel the results would influence my behaviours in terms of conduct or treatment of others in the team. However, because the results provide a level of clarity about what motivates me and the reasons behind particular behaviours, it may influence decisions such as volunteering to undertake a task or project if it suits my strengths.

#### How should I take this into account when forming a team?

From a management standpoint, I believe they offer a valuable insight into the mindset and personality traits of the person taking them, which can help when assembling special project teams or staff structures.

Several months ago, the accounting team I worked for entered a business coaching program and part of the onboarding process was for each team member to undergo a test that identified key personality traits. These results assisted the business owner to determine who in the team would be best suited to particular roles within the business coaching plan. For example, my ID test determined that I would be best suited to the production management role as my practical and logical approach suits the analytical nature of the role. There was another team member whose key traits were more empathetic and emotional, so they became the ‘team cheerleader’ and was responsible for support and team morale, and also for developing strategies that enhanced the client experience.
